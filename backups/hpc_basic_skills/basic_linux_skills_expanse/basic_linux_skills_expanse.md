# Basic Linux Skills on Expanse

[//]: # " Comment example "
[//]: # ( Comment2 )

When you log on to [Expanse](https://expanse.sdsc.edu), your computer operating system will be a Linux or Unix shell.  
"_A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a traditional Unix-like command line user interface. This environment is very different from the easy to use GUI interfaces we have all become used in the Windows and MacOS systems_"  
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell).

Basic Linux skills are necessary to complete the hands-on exercises. If it’s been a while since you’ve worked in a Linux environment, be sure to reacquaint yourself with the following topic (many of which are demonstrated below)s:

- copying, listing, deleting and renaming files  
- using wildcards  
- navigating directories  
- changing file permissions  
- setting environment variables  
- using common utilities (`grep`, `cat`, `less`, `head`, `sort`, `tar`, `gzip`)

This tutorial is focussed on using Linux on the SDSC Expanse supercomputer. There a a lot of other tutorial on the Web:

- A nice tutorial can be found here: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/  
  You should also be comfortable with one of the standard Linux editors, such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`.
- For a fun tutorial on Linux, see the UCSD/SDSC Supercomputing Club's tutorial, based on a Google community project:

:::note
**Notes:**

- For the examples below, we are using the `bash` shell, which is the default shell for new accounts on Expanse. For the purposes of following SDSC tutorials and exercises, please do not change the shell.
- For any Linux command, you can find out what it does by asking for help. The syntax is usually:
  - `command --help`
  - `man command`  → invokes a user guide or manual
  - search the web using google or some other search engine
- In Linux/Unix, everything is a file: a text file, a directory, even the output for a command
- Linux/Unix is case sensitive
