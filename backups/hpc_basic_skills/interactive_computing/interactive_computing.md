# Interactive Computing on the Expanse Cluster

### Overview

Interactive HPC systems allow real-time user inputs in order to facilitate code development, real-time data exploration, and visualizations. An interactive job (also referred as interactive session) will provide you with a shell on a compute node in which you can launch your jobs. In this tutorial we show you how to obtain interactive nodes on SDSC HPC systems.
