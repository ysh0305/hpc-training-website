# Debugging your session

If you experience a problem when launching your Jupyter notebook session
with `galyleo`, you may be able to debug the issue yourself by reviewing
the batch job script generated by `galyleo` or the standard output/error
file generated by the job. These files are stored in the `~/.galyleo` 
directory created in your `$HOME` directory.

## Additional Information

### Expanse User Portal

`galyleo` is integrated with the [Expanse User Portal](https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu).
After logging into the portal with your [ACCESS-CI](https://access-ci.org)
credentials, you can access this web-based frontend interface to `galyleo`
from the pinned *Jupyter* app shown on the main dashboard. You can also
find it located under the the *Interactive Apps* tab in the toolbar 
across the top of your browser window, where you can select the *Jupyter*
app from its drop-down menu.
